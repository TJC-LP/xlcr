 * LibreOffice (via JODConverter) is primarily used for document conversions, not document
 * splitting. For splitting functionality, use:
 *
 *   - Aspose splitters (HIGH priority) - com.tjclp.xlcr.aspose.given
 *   - Core splitters (DEFAULT priority) - com.tjclp.xlcr.core.given
 *
 * If LibreOffice-based splitting becomes available in the future, those given instances will be
 * added here.
